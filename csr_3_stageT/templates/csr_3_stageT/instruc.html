            You are about to start <b>Part 3</b> of the study. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In this part, you will first be assigned to be a <b>Role A</b> participant or a <b>Role F</b> participant. You will be informed of your role through the computer screen and you will <b>keep the same role</b> throughout the entire study.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every Role A participant will be <b>paired </b>with a Role F participant throughout the study.
        </p>
        <p>
            Role A participants will be told how much their Role F participant contributed (overall on average) to the Group Exchange in Part 2.
        </p>
<!--         <p>
            This part of the experiment is divided into 5 identical rounds of the same type of investment game as in Part 2. In each round, both Role A and Role F participants will receive the endowment they earned in Part 1 plus an additional 60 points. In Part 1 your earnings were {{ self_ret_score }}.
        </p> -->
        <hr>
        <p>
            The Role A participant will first make a decision. He or she will choose between A1 and A2.
        <ul>
            <li>A1 means the round ends and both participants again receive the amount they earned during Part 2.
            <li>A2 means Role F will be asked to increase his or her contribution over and above what s/he contributed to the Investment Account in Part 2.
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <p>
        If the Role A participant chooses A2, then the Role F participant makes the next decision:
        <ul>
            <li>F1 means increasing his or her contribution to the investment account in Part 2 by 1.5 times the original contribution. Then, the round ends
            <li>F2 means maintaining his or her original contribution to the investment account. The Role A participant will be asked to make another decision.
        </ul>
        
        <hr>
        <p>
            If the Role F participant chooses F2, the Role A participant chooses between A3 and A4:
        </p>

        <p>
            If the Role A participant chooses A3, both participants again receive the amount they earned during Part 2.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
        If the Role A participant chooses A4, the Role F participantâ€™s payoffs will be randomly selected by the computer:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>With probability 0.75 the Role F participant will contribute 1.5 times his or her original contribution to the Group Earnings
                <li>With probability 0.25, the Role F participant will contribute the same amount that he or she originally contributed
                <li>Role A will contribute twice as much to the Group Exchange
            </ul>
        </p>

            The game is demonstrated in the game tree above. 
        <ul>
            <li><font color="red">RED</font> moves are taken by the <font color='red'>Role A</font> participant, 
            <li><font color="blue">BLUE</font> moves are taken by <font color='blue'>Role F</font> participant and
